***Description From Yelp***:<!--StartFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

> Sabrosa started as a cooking sauce company, selling jars of salsa at area farmers markets in 2015. Executive Chef Frank Sanchez already made a mark on the Milwaukee culinary scene with his popular Bay View restaurant Taqueria Azteca in the 2000s. Each farmers market became a pop-up restaurant as Sanchez cooked up traditional Mexican breakfast favorites under a tent on a camping stove. Many loyal Taqueria customers found him at the market and he made a new following as well. When the opportunity presented itself to purchase a building in Bay View to start a new breakfast/lunch restaurant venture, the timing couldn't have been better. Today at the cafe you can still find the spirit of those original markets as jars of salsa are available for purchase as are the popular market dishes, but you will find an expanded menu to include a broader continental fare including avocado toast, roasted vegetable sandwich, and much more. Also located within the cafe is an art gallery and a grand piano.
