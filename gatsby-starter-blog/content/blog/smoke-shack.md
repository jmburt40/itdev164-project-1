From Visit Milwaukee: "We know that people feel strongly about their barbecue, and so do we. With this in mind, we are excited to share our style of BBQ: certified humanely raised meats dry rubbed, slow smoked and sauced by you, enjoyed in our cozy, rustic restaurant or on our "escape the city" patio."
